          answer={`Epoch is run by Hack Club, a worldwide community of high school hackers
          and after-school coding clubs. It's backed by the likes of Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin 
          and Tom Preston-Werner. Last summer, we organized Assemble, a 42-hour hackathon with 175 
          teenagers, in San Francisco.`}
